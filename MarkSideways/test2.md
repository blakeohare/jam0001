```

testWhileLoop();

sumTest = sumNumbers1To100();
print("Sum of the numbers from 1 to 100:", sumTest);

```

### test while loop

```
i = 0;
while i < 10 {
    print("while: " + i);
    i += 2;
}
```

### sum numbers 1 to 100

```
total = 0;
for i = 1 thru 100 {
    total += i;
}
return total;
```
